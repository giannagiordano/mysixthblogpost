The Heartbeat Orchestra
Ian Hutchinson, Matt Sharp, Alejandro Romero and Annmarie Wadlow

I was drawn to "The Heartbeat Orchestra," created by Ian Hutchinson, Matt Sharp, Alejandro Romero and Annmarie Wadlow because I love the creative ways in which it uses the pulse rates of users to generate both music and visuals. The Heartbeat Orchestra was built for "Bio-Revolution" at the London Science Museum in February 2014 and a second version was present at Secret Garden Party in July 2014. The Heartbeat Orchestra is incredibly interactive - it measures five participants' heart rates and then generates both orchestral music as well as colorful visuals in the center of a podium. It is clear that the artists put a high level of thought into how to incorporate the data they are instantaneously collecting from users into the piece, and I love the intricate method that they created. The way the heart rates are included in the piece is as follows: One person is the conductor, setting the tempo for the rest of the orchestra (based on their pulse), and the other four people are instruments. The instruments include the basoon, cello, guitar, marimba, and piano, and the instrument changes depending on the user's heart rate. Furthermore, I appreciate the aesthetic choices in the visuals. The light green, orange, purple, and blue colors complement the dark red hearts. I also appreciate how the hearts are cartoon-like because it gives off the feeling that the user is playing a game rather than participating in a more scientific activity, which would have been reflected by a more literal representation of the heart. Finally, I enjoy this piece because I think that the choice to use heart rates is super relevant. Owning a fitbit or Apple watch to monitor your pulse is increasingly becoming a trend. As someone who constantly checks their heart rate and monitors its constant ebb and flow, I would find this piece a lot of fun to play around with.

'Open Data Cam'/'Beat the Traffic'

I was drawn to the 'Beat the Traffic' game and other works using the 'Open Data Cam' because, in tandem, they demonstrate the diverse ways in which traffic data can be used. 'Open Data Cam' is a tool created by the Moovel Lab that uses computer vision to quantify the visuals that it sees. Therefore, the most obvious use of this technology is quantifying traffic at a particular point in a city. I enjoyed the 'Beat the Traffic' game, which was also created by the Moovel Lab, because it turns the visuals captured by the 'Open Data Cam' into a fun, interactive game. To get points, users have to click the targets on the vehicles with a mouse-controlled magic wand to convert the vehicles into unicorns, rainbows, and driving trees. I love the playful aesthetic, which is completmented by the font, emoji-like images, and light yellow, blue, and pink colors. Users can choose between eleven different cities including Barcelona, New York, and Tokyo. To connect the game back to a serious topic, a user's high score is converted into how many buses would have been needed to transport the cars they successfully converted. This draws attention to the fact that, today, there is an excess of cars on the road that could more efficiently be replaced by fewer buses. In the game. this combination of playfulness and seriousness is also reflected by the pairing of emoji-like features with literal cities in the background. I find this synthesis of an abstract, entertaining game and a momentus topic incredibly clever, and I think it shows just how much can be done with the 'Open Data Cam'. Exploring the work of the Moovel Lab and stumbling upon the 'Beat the Traffic' game made me want to think more about the strategy of using an interactive game to get across a more noteworthy topic. I also find it interesting to think more about how many ways this new technology can be used. Beyond collecting traffic data, it could be used to track pedestrians, assess customer-bases of local stores, or even enforce littering policies! All of these things could also be displayed on a spectrum ranging from literal to abstract. The 'Open Data Cam' and 'Beat the Traffic' showed me how exciting it is to think about the many ways data from outside sources can be utilized as well as how creativity can be used strategically.
